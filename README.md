This 'General Store Management System' is a full-stack web application developed to streamline and digitize the daily operations of a village-based general store. The project focuses on solving real-world problems faced by store owners, such as tracking item inventory and managing customer credit (loans). It allows the owner to add new types of items, update their quantity and price, and automatically highlights when stock is low. More importantly, it simplifies loan management by maintaining detailed records of customers who buy on creditâ€”including the items purchased, loan dates, and return status. The system also provides timely alerts for due loan returns and stock shortages, reducing manual effort and errors. Built using React for the frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend, and MySQL for data storage, this solution offers a reliable and user-friendly way to efficiently manage the store and enhance decision-making.
